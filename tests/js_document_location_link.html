<p>This only works when not loaded from a local file. That is, this
   page must be requested through a webserver. If used through a file://
   location, then the request origin will appear to be the directory
   this file is in, not the full path with the filename, and thus it
   won't match any url in open tabs and the redirect notification won't
   be shown.</p>
