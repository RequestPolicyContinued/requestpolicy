## About RequestPolicy

RequestPolicy is a browser extension for Firefox(\*) and SeaMonkey that gives you control over cross-site requests. It does this through user-defined whitelists and blacklists. Users can also subscribe to policies (whitelists and blacklists) maintained by others.

Have a look at our [**wiki**](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/wiki), especially the [**Quick Start**](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/wiki/Quickstart) guide and the [**FAQ**](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/wiki/FAQ).

(\*) Firefox 57+ is [not yet supported](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues/704)
