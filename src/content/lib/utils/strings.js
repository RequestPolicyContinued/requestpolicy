     * added/removed) The apparently accepted solution to reliably load new
     * versions is to always create bundles with a unique URL so as to bypass the
     * cache. This is accomplished by passing a random number in a parameter after
     * a '?'. (this random ID is otherwise ignored) The loaded string bundle is
     * still cached on startup and should still be cleared out of the cache on
     * addon shutdown. This just bypasses the built-in cache for repeated loads of
     * the same path so that a newly installed update loads cleanly. */
